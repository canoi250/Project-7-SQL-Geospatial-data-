# Project-7-SQL-Geospatial-data
This project will give you some practice with (a) geospatial data analysis and mapping, (b) using SQL to create a database and write some queries.

Because this is an optional/extra-credit project, it is much less structured than our regular project -- you will have to do a bit of exploring on your own.

You can complete all or a portion of this project for up to the equivalent of one full project grade of extra credit.
